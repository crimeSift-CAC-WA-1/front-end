              {`This conversation is between an FBI detective detectives and a group of students who have developed an AI tool to analyze large datasets of text messages, which could be useful in law enforcement investigations.

          The students explain their AI model can process huge chat logs, flagging messages relevant to specific queries, such as threats of school violence or discussions of drug sales. This drastically shortens the time detectives need to spend manually reviewing messages. They initially used a "dolphin AI" model but switched to Google AI due to concerns about terms of service and limitations of other models. Their tool can also parse Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal chats, and they offer to develop custom export tools for platforms like Discord, which lack built-in options. They even suggest expanding the tool to analyze phone calls and audio files, assessing tone and language nuances beyond just keywords.

          The detectives express strong interest and ask several clarifying questions. They highlight the legal and ethical considerations of using such a tool, emphasizing the need for warrants and probable cause, as well as the importance of protecting privacy. They mention their department recently released a policy on AI use and that they work closely with the prosecutor's office to ensure new tools are legally defensible. They also discuss the limitations of current forensic tools like GrayKey and Cellebrite, which often provide unwieldy, unorganized data dumps, and express a desire for tools that can present data in a timeline format.
          The students address these concerns, explaining how their tool can be trained to improve accuracy and filter irrelevant information. They offer to adapt the tool to fit the detectivesâ€™ specific needs, including developing features to focus on content from specific apps and present the data in a more user-friendly timeline format. They also acknowledge the challenge of obtaining data from different providers, like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Apple, who provide data in different formats and often require manual processing. The detectives express interest in using the tool primarily with consent from victims or witnesses who are willing to share their data, recognizing that warrant returns can be overwhelming to process.

          The students also discuss their motivation for developing this tool, citing concerns about lengthy investigations hindering justice in cases involving large quantities of message data. The detectives are impressed by their dedication and offer to explore how to get the tool approved for departmental use, while also cautioning about the potentially slow approval process. The meeting ends with an agreement for a follow-up after the students finish their project. The detectives also provide the names of current forensic software they use (GrayKey and Cellebrite) and express the importance of any new tool being able to generate detailed log files for accountability and authentication purposes.`}
